    <h1>Virtual Reality (VR)</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      What is Virtual Reality? Virtual reality, or VR, is a three-dimensional,
      computer-generated environment that can be explored and interacted with by
      a person. That person becomes a part of that world, and can manipulate
      objects or perform a series of actions within the environment. Virtual
      reality is created using VR software and hardware, and it is typically
      experienced through a headset worn by the user.

      The goal of VR is to immerse the user in a simulated environment that
      feels real and allows them to interact with it as if it were real. For
      example, in a VR game, the player may be able to pick up and throw
      objects, or move around the environment. In a VR training program, the
      user may be able to perform tasks within a realistic environment, such as
      fixing a machine or driving a car. VR has been used for decades, but it
      has only become widely available in the past few years. Oculus Rift and
      HTC Vive are two of the most popular VR headsets on the market, and there
      are many different VR programs and games available. Virtual reality has a
      number of potential applications, including education, training,
      entertainment, and more. For example, VR can be used to give users a
      realistic experience of what it would be like to drive a car, or to train
      surgeons in performing delicate operations. VR can also be used to create
      immersive, realistic games that provide an escape from reality.
